This Repository contains a model of C4 electron tranport and C4 biochemistry that was puiblished with the original research article 'Reduction of bundle sheath size boosts cyclic electron flow in C4 Setaria viridis acclimated to low light' by Chandra Bellasio and Maria Ermakova in the Plant Journal.
The model is organized to simulate two compartments representing M and BS cells (Figure 2): each harvests light to drive a distinct electron transport chain (Note S1, Figure S1). In both electron transport chains, the ratio between the rates of ATP and NADPH production is varied via adjustment of CEF (through the parameter fCyc), which may flow through PGR5/PGRL1 or the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH, adjusted through the parameter fNDH). When fCyc is adjusted, the proportion of light absorbed by photosystems varies to maintain invariant the sum of light absorbed by the two [equations described in supporting information of Yin et al. (2004)]. This is of key importance when modelling energetics and CEF engagement under limiting light (Bellasio, 2019) because, otherwise, supplemental CEF would be driven by an increase in light absorbed [but s would be invariant, main text of Yin et al. (2004)]. The reducing power requirements for nitrogen reduction and for the water-water cycle are explicitly accounted for as a fraction of pseudo-cyclic electron flow, after Yin and Struik (2012), but we did not use the functionality in this study. A key innovation is that the rate of oxygen evolution in the BS is calculated from the actual rate of electron transport in both compartments, instead of being assumed to scale to assimilation through the parameter α as in all the models derived from Berry and Farquhar (1978). 
ATP and NADPH drive the reactions of the carbon metabolism, described following Bellasio and Griffiths (2014c), McQualter et al. (2016), and Bellasio (2017). While the NADPH available in the BS is consumed by the RPP and the photorespiratory cycles, the ATP available in the M and any ATP surplus in the BS are consumed by the C4 cycle, until all the ATP and NADPH available have been consumed. In this way, the partitioning between cycles and the apportioning of metabolic work between M and BS cells emerges directly from the rate of ATP and NADPH produced by light reactions, instead of being assumed through the parameter x as in all the approaches following Berry and Farquhar (1978). Differently from Bellasio (2017), where all intermediate photosynthetic types were modelled, here C4 photosynthesis is fully expressed, such that the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) and Rubisco are both fully compartmentalised to BS cells (Bellasio, 2017). However, C4 subtypes can be changed seamlessly, forming a continuous biochemical space that can be explored by varying two parameters: fMDH, representing the engagement of MDH in M cells and controlling the trajectory between the NADP-ME subtype and the NAD-ME subtype, and fPEPCK, representing the capacity of PEPCK to consume ATP available in BS cells and representing the level of PEPCK expression relative to other carboxylases (we will explore these functionalities in dedicated studies). In the decarboxylation of malate, the co-products NADH and NADPH are assumed to be equivalent or interconvertible. This may be underpinned by an actual biochemical interconversion, mediated by the intercellular operation of the malate shuttle (Furbank, 2011), or simply by the capacity of malic enzyme (ME) to dock both cofactors, as suggested by early studies (Kanai and Edwards, 1973). 
M and BS cells are connected by an exchange of metabolites (malate, MAL; phosphoenolpyruvate, PEP; pyruvate, PYR; aspartate, ASP; alanine, ALA; 3-phosphoglyceric acid, PGA; dihydroxyacetone phosphate, DHAP; and CO2) which diffuse obeying mass balance constraints. Diffusion is non-limited, except that of CO2, restrained by a finite conductance (gBS) that allows higher CO2 concentration in BS cells (CBS) based on classical underpinnings (Berry and Farquhar, 1978). Glutamate and αKG do not diffuse directly between M and BS cells, but exchange amino-groups with ALA and PYR (Pick et al., 2011, Mallmann et al., 2014, Schlüter et al., 2019). If reactions can proceed in opposite direction, they are assumed to proceed only in the direction with positive balance. Respiration is a shared process between M and BS cells. To avoid a futile cycle consisting of concurrent glycolysis and carbohydrate synthesis, respiration is assumed to be supplied by new assimilates (PGA) in line with Bellasio and Griffiths (2014c). The ATP and NADH produced during respiration are neglected, assumed to be consumed by basal metabolism. Any ATP and NADH residual imbalances produced during respiration in the light are absent, supported by the analysis of Buckley and Adams (2011) who proposed they would be dissipated by alternative oxidases. The final product of photosynthesis is a generic triose carbohydrate, whose destiny is not further followed by the model.
